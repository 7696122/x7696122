```sh
# Unversioned symlinks `python`, `python-config`, `pip` etc. pointing to
# `python3`, `python3-config`, `pip3` etc., respectively, have been installed into
#   /usr/local/opt/python@3.10/libexec/bin

# You can install Python packages with
#   /usr/local/opt/python@3.10/bin/pip3 install <package>
# They will install into the site-package directory
#   /usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages

# tkinter is no longer included with this formula, but it is available separately:
#   brew install python-tk@3.10

# See: https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python

# python@3.10 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
# because this is an alternate version of another formula.

# If you need to have python@3.10 first in your PATH, run:
#   echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python@3.10/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python@3.10/bin:$PATH"

# For compilers to find python@3.10 you may need to set:
#   export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/python@3.10/lib"
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/python@3.10/lib"

# For pkg-config to find python@3.10 you may need to set:
#   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/python@3.10/lib/pkgconfig"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/python@3.10/lib/pkgconfig"
```
